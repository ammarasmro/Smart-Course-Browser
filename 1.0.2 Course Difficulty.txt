[MUSIC] Welcome to an Introduction to
Software Product Management. This is the first course in the software
product management specialization, and it's also the shortest. In these first two weeks we will describe
the role of a software product manager. Show interviews with software
product managers and those who work with them
in the software industry. Explain what Agile software
development is all about. And give you a sense of the topics that
will be covered as you progress through the specialization. By the end of this introductory course, you will know if this specialization
will meet your personal learning goals. If you have a background in software
development, you may find the technical information presented in this
introductory course as basic. But for those outside the software field,
provide some key terms and concepts that will be fundamental to
the remainder of the specialization. If you find yourself hungry for
more at the end of this course, please continue on to the next
course in our specialization. An effective software product
manager is a good listener. Someone able to imagine
a valuable product, from users who may not fully express or
appreciate their own needs. Being a good listener is like
being an active learner. When you're open to learning, even one new thing could dramatically
transform your understanding of the world. We hope you will learn many things as you delve into the software product
management specialization. And we look forward to hearing
your viewpoints in the forums.
